# Advent of Code

This repository hosts my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com),
using Python.

These aren't the most elegant solutions, and I'm not trying to get on the
leaderboards (the puzzles are published each day at 5am in my timezone, when
I'm very much definitely sleeping).  In fact, they're probably not very good
Python at all, as it's not a language I'd consider myself to be an expert in.

If you're participating in AoC this year, please don't look at my solutions
until you've solved the puzzle for yourself. Where's the fun in that?! But
do come back and take a look when you've solved them, and feel free to
[start up a discussion](https://github.com/yeurch/advent-of-code/discussions).

### System Requirements

Running the solutions requires Python *3.9* or later.  This is required for
(at the very least) the use of the high-precision timer `time.time_ns()`.

### License

My solutions are licensed under the [MIT license](./LICENSE).
